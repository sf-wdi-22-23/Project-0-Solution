# Project 0 Solution

###This is a solution to project zero. You are welcome to clone this to run it and see how it works. If you clone this and or copy and paste code into your solution, we WILL be able to tell. DO NOT DO THIS. 
###You are welcome to peek at this when you are REALLY STUCK and have googled and asked for help from cohort mates, etc. This solution is nice and OO. Do you best to make yours OO, but prioritize getting it working for now. Refactor if you have time.
###Good luck!
